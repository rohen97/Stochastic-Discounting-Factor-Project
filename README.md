# Suppose that consumption growth has lognormal distribution with the possibility of rare disasters:


# Here ε is a standard normal random variable, while ν is an independent random variable that has value of either zero 
# (with probability of 98.3%) or ln(0.65) (with probability of 1.7%).

# Simulate ε with (at least) 104 random draws from standard normal distribution,
# and simulate ν with (at least) 104 random draws from standard uniform distribution.

# Use the simulated distribution of consumption growth to find the simulated distribution of the pricing kernel for power utility:


# Repeat this process for values of γ in the range from 1 to 4, in increments of 0.1 (or less). 
#(You can reuse the same simulated distribution of consumption growth for all values of γ)

# Calculate the mean (μM) and standard deviation (σM) of pricing kernel for each value of γ, 
# and plot the volatility ratio (σM/μM) on the vertical axis vs γ on the horizontal axis.

# Find the smallest value of γ (in your data) for which σM/μM > 0.4. Explain (in words, without using mathematical equations or formulas) 
# the economic significance of this result.
